                    <div class="col-md-9">
                        <p>I have worked for the GeoRover software team for almost 4 years taking on various responsibilities, and
                            due to the size of the team, each member covers a lot of ground.</p>
                        <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> My GIS and technical background has enabled me to assist the development team with product development and software testing.  
                            Knowledge of geospatial software and geographic concepts contributed to establishing a more comprensive testing phase, which
                            was one of my first projects with the team. I developed unit tests for our installer to alleviate some of the testing workload.
                            Now the testing phase contributes to the release of a more refined product to our customers.  My responsiblity with customers where identifying end-user 
                            requirements, troubleshooting technical issues, and improving customer relations. I manage many customers of varying size, but my largest account is National 
                            Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.</p>
                        <p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> I received an award for "exceptional contribution, dedication, and support to teamwork and collaboration".  
                        My unique role supporting development and customers lead to being appointed Release Manager by the team.  Supplemental responsiblities were overseeing 
                        each product release and minimizing oversight.  A procedure document was produced to outline the steps completed by each team member.</p>

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Dr. Michael Barber, the State Archaeologist for the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, was applying for a 
                            state grant to preserve Werowocomoco.  This archaeological site is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Werowocomoco/@37.4096758,-76.65748,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b0906d2c6c95cf:0xc9dfbaf3945d33ff!8m2!3d37.4096758!4d-76.655286">
                            located along the York River alongside Purtan Bay</a>.  This location was the primary village of Paramount Chief Powhatan. Excavations have demonstrated that the 
                            site was occupied from AD 1400 and that the village was divided by landscape manipulation into secular and sacred areas.</p>
                            <p><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Publicly available satellite imagery, historic topographic maps, and geospatial data provided essential information to assess the amount of 
                            landform change that occured. Geospatial techniques (georeferencing and GPS field assessment) were performed to illustrate and map the coastal morpholgy change.
                            A geomorpholgy report on these measurements helped outline a case for funding the preservation of this histroical site.</p>
