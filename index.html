                            <p>Hi! I'm Brad Anderson &#8212; a  James Madison University graduate in Geographic Science.  
                                During my undergrad, my coursework focused around information systems with an emphasis in Geography.
                                My current position as a GIS Engineer has employed my foundation in GIS while refining my technical
                                abilities.  Geospatial analysis, web development, and data visualization are some related subjects I have showed interest 
                                and continue to evolve.</p>
                            <p>Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy being active outdoors, playing competitive sports/games, and reading a good book. <br>
                            In general, I am an animal person, but I defintely gravitate towards dogs. I plan on getting a pup in the future to join my active lifestyle.</p>

                                <p>Sea-level rise (SLR) is widely discussed as a major consequence of global warming. This positive correlation is a major concern for 
                                    communities close to the shoreline.  Various models allow local governments to predict and prepare for marine innundation, and the Sea Level Rise Viewer, 
                                    developed by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management, is the model which we provide the most scrutiny and which variables were left unaccounted.</p>
                                <p>Geospatial data collected from various sources allowed us to locate current coastal protection techniques and severity of erosion along the shore. 
                                    Well-documented and dated archaeological sites were used as landmarks for determining stable land surfaces of the Holocene period. Old maps collected 
                                    from the USGS and the Library of Virginia allowed us to visualize Saxis’ and Hunting Creek’s change in coastal geography over the last few hundred years.  
                                    Field work on Hunting Creek was conducted to ground-truth the model and determined whether the predicted 1’ impacts are already evident.</p>

                                Leveraging CARTO as the platform, I built this map to tally the trails I travel, it just a start as there are many more trails to be included and traveled.</p>

                            <p>I have worked for the GeoRover software team for almost 4 years taking on various responsibilities, and
                                due to the size of the team, each member covers a lot of ground.</p>
                            <p>My GIS and technical background has enabled me to assist the development team with product development and software testing.  
                                Knowledge of geospatial software and geographic concepts contributed to establishing a more comprensive testing phase, which
                                one of my first projects with the team, and now it contributes to the release of a more refined product to our customers.  
                                Later, I was appointed release manager due to my role supporting development and customers.  The release phase has now been 
                                defined with a supplemental checklist to provide transparency between the development team and sales team.</p>
                            <p>As for handling customers, my main tasks are identifying end-user requirements, troubleshooting technical issues, 
                                and improving customer relations. I manage many customers of varying size, but my largest account is National

                            <p>My professioner at James Madison University asked if I was interested in doing work for Dr. 
                                Michael Barber, the State Archaeologist for the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Using satellite imagery, historic maps,
                                and geospatial data I was able to measure landform change that occured in the past century. A map was produce to visualize the change, 
                                which helped outline a case for funding the preservation of a signficant Archaeologist site called Werowocomoco.</p>
                            <p>Werowocomoco is a site of international significance and was the site of Paramount Chief Powhatan’s primary village.  
                                It was here that John Smith first met Powhatan and also where Pocahontas saved Smith from having his head bashed in.  
                                Excavations have demonstrated that the site was occupied from AD 1400 and that the village was divided by landscape manipulation into 
                                secular and sacred areas.</p>
