                            <p>Hi! I'm Brad Anderson &#8212; a  James Madison University graduate in Geographic Science.  
                                During my undergrad, my coursework focused around information systems with an emphasis in Geography.
                                My current position as a GIS Engineer has employed my foundation in GIS while refining my technical
                                abilities.  Intelligence analysis, web development, data visualization are some related subjects I have showed interest 
                                and continue to evolve.</p>
                            <p>Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy being active outdoors, playing competitive sports/games, and reading a good book.<br>
                                Also, Dogs are easily the best companions although I do not current own a dog.</p>
                            <h4>Contact me</h4>
                            <p>Send me an <a href="mailto:brad.j.anderson22@gmail.com">email</a>, and I will respond as soon as possible. </p>

                                <p>Sea-level rise (SLR) is widely discussed as a major consequence of global warming. This positive correlation is a major concern for 
                                    communities close to the shoreline.  Various models allow local governments to predict and prepare for marine innundation.  The Sea Level Rise Viewer, 
                                    developed by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management, is the model which we provide the most scrutiny and which variables were left unaccounted.</p>
                                <p>Geospatial data collected from various sources allowed us to locate current coastal protection techniques and severity of erosion along the shore. 
                                    Well-documented and dated archaeological sites were used as landmarks for determining stable land surfaces of the Holocene period. Old maps collected 
                                    from the USGS and the Library of Virginia allowed us to visualize Saxis’ and Hunting Creek’s change in coastal geography over the last few hundred years.  
                                    Field work on Hunting Creek was conducted to ground-truth the model and determined whether the predicted 1’ impacts are already evident.</p>

                                <p>This website can be defined as a brother's venture.  The three of us decided we wanted to brush up on our writing skills, but also stay "hip". 
                                    The website started out rather sparse and intimidating, it grew into a quick resource to see some of the latest men's gear. I was invloved in assisting 
                                    the website design and implmentation and initiated the advertising campaigns via social media.</p>

                            <p>I have worked for the GeoRover software team for almost 4 years. My responsibilities have varied, 
                                but each task have revolved around improving the teams' procedures through automation, documentation, 
                                and transparency.  We are a small team, so each one of us covers a lot of ground.</p>
                            <p>My GIS and technical background has enabled me to develop use cases and detailed demostrations to customers, which I have presented at 
                                tradeshows, conferences, and meetings.  Testing is another area in which I assist. Original test plans I built implmented an organized 
                                testing phase in our software development lifecycle.</p>
                            <p>Tracking customer purchases, identifying end-user requirements, reporting software bugs, and 
                                troubleshooting technical issues are some of the tasks I handle on a weekly basis. The largest account 
                                I manage orders, requirements, and bugs for is the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  Most customer's which 
                                purchase GeoRover products are government organizations, but I oversee with commerical business accounts as well.</p>
