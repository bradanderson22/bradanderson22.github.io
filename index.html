                            <p>Hi! I'm Brad Anderson &#8212; a  James Madison University graduate in Geographic Science.  
                                During my undergrad, my coursework focused around information systems with an emphasis in Geography.
                                My current position as a GIS Engineer has employed my foundation in GIS while refining my technical
                                abilities.  Geospatial analysis, web development, and data visualization are some related subjects I have showed interest 
                                and continue to evolve.</p>
                            <p>Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy being active outdoors, playing competitive sports/games, and reading a good book. <br>
                            In general, I am an animal person, but I defintely gravitate towards dogs. I plan on getting a pup in the future to join my active lifestyle.</p>

                                <p>Sea-level rise (SLR) is widely discussed as a major consequence of global warming. This positive correlation is a major concern for 
                                    communities close to the shoreline.  Various models allow local governments to predict and prepare for marine innundation, and the Sea Level Rise Viewer, 
                                    developed by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management, is the model which we provide the most scrutiny and which variables were left unaccounted.</p>
                                <p>Geospatial data collected from various sources allowed us to locate current coastal protection techniques and severity of erosion along the shore. 
                                    Well-documented and dated archaeological sites were used as landmarks for determining stable land surfaces of the Holocene period. Old maps collected 
                                    from the USGS and the Library of Virginia allowed us to visualize Saxis’ and Hunting Creek’s change in coastal geography over the last few hundred years.  
                                    Field work on Hunting Creek was conducted to ground-truth the model and determined whether the predicted 1’ impacts are already evident.</p>

                            <p>I have worked for the GeoRover software team for almost 4 years taking on various responsibilities, and
                                due to the size of the team, each member covers a lot of ground.</p>
                            <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> My GIS and technical background has enabled me to assist the development team with product development and software testing.  
                                Knowledge of geospatial software and geographic concepts contributed to establishing a more comprensive testing phase, which
                                was one of my first projects with the team. I developed unit tests for our installer to alleviate some of the testing workload.
                                Now the testing phase contributes to the release of a more refined product to our customers.  My responsiblity with customers where identifying end-user 
                                requirements, troubleshooting technical issues, and improving customer relations. I manage many customers of varying size, but my largest account is National 
                                Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.</p>
                            <p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> I received an award for "exceptional contribution, dedication, and support to teamwork and collaboration".  
                            My unique role supporting development and customers lead to being appointed Release Manager by the team.  Supplemental responsiblities were overseeing 
                            each product release and minimizing oversight.  A procedure document was produced to outline the steps completed by each team member.</p>

                                located along the York River alongside Purtan Bay</a>.  This location was the primary village of Paramount Chief Powhatan. Excavations have demonstrated that the 
                                site was occupied from AD 1400 and that the village was divided by landscape manipulation into secular and sacred areas. </p>
                                <p><strong>Responsibility: </strong>Publicly available satellite imagery, historic topographic maps, and geospatial data provided essential information to assess the amount of 
                                landform change that occured. Geospatial techniques (georeferencing and GPS field assessment) were performed to illustrate and map the coastal morpholgy change.
                                A geomorpholgy report on these measurements helped outline a case for funding the preservation of this histroical site.</p>
